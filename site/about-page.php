                    <blockquote>Imagine a corporation that engages in economic activity without guidance or direction from humans. Programmed with a mission statement-maximize profit for shareholders from the sale of widgets, for example-the corporation could own capital, enter contracts, and employ robots. People could even be hired for more creative tasks. <br>
						Such an entity would live on the Internet, distributed across thousands or millions of nodes (stakeholders who host the DAC on their computer). -- www.economist.com</blockquote>
